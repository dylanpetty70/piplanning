## 0.1.0
* Add Changelog
* Add results array to SimpleDie and StaticRoll, which are turned off by default
* `DiceLogic` returns a `resultsArr` by default.
* styles added to shrink SimpleDie to a more appropriate size
* maximum or minimum roles now have unique styles
* removed standardDice, as they added too little value

## 0.0.2
